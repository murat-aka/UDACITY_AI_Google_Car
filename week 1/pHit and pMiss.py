#Write code that outputs p after multiplying each entry 
#by pHit or pMiss at the appropriate places. Remember that
#the red cells 1 and 2 are hits and the other green cells
#are misses.


p=[0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2,0.2]
pHit = 0.6
pMiss = 0.2

#Enter code here

p[0]= p[0] * pMiss 
p[1]= p[1] * pHit 
p[2]= p[2] * pHit
p[3]= p[3] * pMiss
p[4]= p[4] * pMiss

print p
